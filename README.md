# Overview of the Accursed Tomb
The Accursed Tomb is a four player game played with dice, two decks of playing cards, four coins, and four players.

# Setup / Starting Configuration
The initial playing field is delt with an 8x8 grid of cards, face down.
All four players coins are placed on the bottom right corner of the playing field.
The turns then begin, with each player from left to right making one move each turn.

# Turns
During their turn, each player may do one of the following two options:
- Move left, right, up, down, or diagonal one card. If the card is not yet revealed it will be revealed. (Multiple players may reside on the same card)
    - If the card revealed is a wall (a four or five of any suit), the players move is cancelled and no players may move to the wall
    - If the card revealed is a monster (meaning a card between 7 and 10), the player's move is cancelled and combat begins. (See combat section)
    - Otherwise, the player may move onto the card.
- Do nothing (wait and restore 1 hp)
# Combat
Combat begins when a player is adjacent to a monster card. Each player begins with 10HP, and each monster has a HP equal to the number on their card.

For every turn the player is in combat, the monster rolls first. The monster rolls one single sided die to determine its damage. Demons (10s) do 1 point more of damage than all other cards.

The player then rolls one dice. The player does damage equal do their roll multiplied by the number of weapons they possess (See weapons section).

The player's HP is also multiplied by the number of armors they possess (See armor section).

When the monster is killed (HP <= 0), the monster card turns to a normal tile (a king)

If the player is killed, they are eliminated from the game. (Unless they have a blessing, see blessings section)

# Traps
If the player encounters a trap card (Joker), their HP is divided by two, rounding down.

# Fountain
If the player encounters a fountain, flip a coin. If the fountain is heads, the player's HP is doubled or is set to max HP (whichever is lower), otherwise, their HP is divided by two, rounding down.

# Blessing
If the player encounters a blessing (A queen), the card is returned to the players inventory and exchanged for a king (An empty hallway). They then gain an extra life. If the player is killed during combat, they are restored to full HP, and the blessing is discarded)
# Altar
If the player encounters an altar, flip a coin. If the altar is heads, the player gets a blessing. If the coin is tails, their HP is divided by two, rounding down.

# Portal
If the player encounters a portal (2 clubs), they may move to any tile on the map during their turn.

# Merchant
If the player encounters a merchant (2 diamonds), they may chose an armor or a weapon. The card is then reset to a hallway (king)

# Demon
If the player encounters a demon (10), combat begins. (See combat section)
If the player kills a demon, they win the game.

# Hallway
Any card that is not a wall, monster, trap, fountain, blessing, altar, portal, merchant, or demon is a hallway. Hallways are empty tiles that the player may move through.

# Objective
The game continues until either all players are eliminated (in which case the final player wins), or a demon is killed (in which case the player that killed the demon wins).

# Weapons
Weapons are cards that are picked up by the player. They are used in combat to increase the players damage. The player's damage is multiplied by the number of weapons they possess.

# Armor
Armor is cards that are picked up by the player. They are used in combat to increase the players HP. The player's HP is multiplied by the number of armors they possess.
